# ‚ö° Deep Learning for Energy Demand Forecasting: A Time Series Approach

## üåü Project Overview

This project implements a **Deep Learning approach for Time Series Forecasting**, specifically focusing on **hourly energy demand prediction** (PJM Interconnection hourly load data). It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from data ingestion and preprocessing to building, training, and evaluating a neural network model (LSTM-based) to predict future energy consumption. Accurate energy forecasting is critical for grid stability, resource allocation, and market efficiency in the energy sector.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Real-world Time Series Application:** Addresses a high-impact problem in the energy domain, showcasing practical application of ML.
* **Deep Learning for Sequential Data:** Implements a neural network (Keras/TensorFlow) designed to capture complex temporal dependencies in time series data.
* **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Includes techniques tailored for time series, such as normalization and sequence splitting for supervised learning.
* **Model Training & Evaluation:** Demonstrates a full training loop with loss monitoring and prepares for robust performance evaluation of forecasts.
* **Reproducible Workflow:** Designed as a Google Colab notebook for easy setup, execution, and experimentation.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deep Dive & Methodology

The core components and workflow of this project include:

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    * Reads hourly energy demand data from a `cleaned_PJME_hourly.csv` file, demonstrating experience with real-world datasets.
    * Parses 'Datetime' column and sets it as the index, ensuring proper time-series indexing.
2.  **Time Series Preprocessing:**
    * **Data Normalization:** Employs `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` to scale time series features, crucial for neural network stability and performance.
    * **Sequence Creation:** Implements logic to transform raw time series into sequences (input features and target labels) suitable for supervised learning with recurrent neural networks (`split_sequence` function).
3.  **Deep Learning Model Architecture:**
    * Utilizes `tf.keras.models` to build a sequential neural network model.
    * **Inferred:** Likely incorporates **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers, given its strong capability to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, ideal for time series forecasting. (If other RNNs or CNNs for sequences are used, that would be specified).
    * Model summary (`model.summary()`) provides insight into the network's layers and parameter count.
4.  **Model Training:**
    * Trains the neural network using `model.fit()`, optimizing parameters to minimize a chosen loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression).
    * Training history (`history.history['loss']`) is tracked for visualization and convergence monitoring.
5.  **Performance Evaluation & Visualization:**
    * Plots training loss over epochs (`matplotlib.pyplot`) to assess model convergence and identify overfitting/underfitting.
    * **Inferred:** A full project would extend this to evaluate forecasting performance on unseen test data using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and visualize actual vs. predicted values.

## üìä Results (Training Performance)

The model's training performance can be observed from the loss curves:

* A plot of `history.history['loss']` indicates how well the model is learning over epochs.
* **Inferred:** A well-converged model would show a decreasing loss, eventually plateauing, suggesting successful learning of temporal patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning Utilities:** Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Environment:** Google Colab (for GPU-accelerated development)

## üìà Future Work & Enhancements

To build upon this foundation and evolve into a more advanced forecasting system:

* **Advanced Time Series Models:** Explore more complex deep learning architectures like:
    * **Encoder-Decoder LSTMs:** For sequence-to-sequence forecasting.
    * **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs):** For capturing long-range dependencies with convolutional layers.
    * **Transformers for Time Series:** Leveraging attention mechanisms for improved sequence modeling.
* **Multi-Step Forecasting:** Extend the model to predict multiple future time steps, crucial for operational planning.
* **Exogenous Variables:** Incorporate additional relevant features (e.g., weather data, holidays, economic indicators) that influence energy demand.
* **Uncertainty Quantification:** Implement methods (e.g., Bayesian Neural Networks, Monte Carlo dropout) to provide prediction intervals, giving a measure of forecast confidence.
